ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure high-quality and reliable code. It emphasizes test trustworthiness and incorporates the Devil's Advocate mindset to challenge assumptions and improve test coverage.

ðŸ“– What is TDD?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written before the actual implementation. It follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

Red - Write a failing test (because the functionality does not exist yet).

Green - Write minimal code to make the test pass.

Refactor - Improve the code while ensuring tests still pass.

ðŸ“œ Three Rules of TDD

To effectively follow TDD, developers should adhere to these three fundamental rules:

Write only enough of a test to fail. Do not write more than necessary.

Write only enough production code to make the test pass. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

Refactor the code while keeping the tests passing. Optimize the implementation without changing behavior.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals of This Project

Implement core functionalities using TDD principles.

Ensure trustworthy tests (No false positives or negatives, repeatable, independent).

Use a Devil's Advocate approach to uncover hidden issues.
