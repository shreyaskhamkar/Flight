Red-Green-Refactor: The Heart of Test-Driven Development (TDD)
The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is the core concept of Test-Driven Development (TDD). It ensures that code is written with proper testing and follows an iterative improvement process.

## The Three Phases of Red-Green-Refactor
1️⃣ Red – Write a Failing Test
Write a test before writing the actual code.
The test should fail initially because the functionality doesn’t exist yet.
This step helps define the expected behavior of the code.
✅ Goal: Make sure the test correctly captures the requirement.

2️⃣ Green – Write the Minimum Code to Pass the Test
Write just enough code to make the test pass.
No extra logic, just the simplest implementation that works.
✅ Goal: Get a working solution as quickly as possible.

3️⃣ Refactor – Improve the Code Without Changing Behavior
Clean up and optimize the code while ensuring tests still pass.
Remove duplication, improve readability, and follow best practices.
✅ Goal: Make the code cleaner and maintainable without changing functionality.
